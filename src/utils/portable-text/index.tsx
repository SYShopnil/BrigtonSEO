/*
	TODO: Check implementation of portable text and custom components.

  In order to portable text we call PortableText component and pass our api array as value
  and our component rendering instructions as components prop.

  <PortableText
    value={PortableTextSample}
    components={myPortableTextComponents}
  />

export { PortableTextSample } from './sample';
export { CustomComponents } from './config';
